La-la, la-la, la
Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's tellin' me to go home (home)
But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own
Uh, lotta years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes
Forever and ever, no more

The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds
Oh
